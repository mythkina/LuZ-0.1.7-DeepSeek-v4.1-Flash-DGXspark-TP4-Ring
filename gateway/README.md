# `gateway/` — streaming-aware concurrency proxy

A single-file [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/) service that fronts the inference
engine and owns the parts of serving the engine does not: admission, liveness of idle
streams, request equivalence, and client-side input hygiene.

```
client ──►  gateway :8001  ──►  engine (OpenAI-compatible)
              │
              ├─ SSE heartbeat            idle streams survive minute-scale prefills
              ├─ TTFT budget              fail fast instead of holding a slot to nowhere
              ├─ backpressure admission   MAX_CONCURRENCY + bounded queue -> 429 + Retry-After
              ├─ equivalence dedup        same body hash -> 429, no second full prefill
              ├─ disconnect propagation   client gone -> upstream cancelled
              ├─ image-placeholder guard  literal image tokens rewritten, not rejected
              └─ /health, /gw/metrics
```

## Files

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `concurrency_proxy_v2.py` | the proxy — one file, no package, no config file of its own |
| `concurrency-proxy-v2.env.example` | every knob with its default and the reasoning behind it |
| `concurrency-proxy-v2.service.example` | systemd unit sample |
| `test_sanitize_image_placeholders.py` | unit tests for the G7 sanitizer (15 assertions, fail-closed) |

Requires `aiohttp` only. Python 3.8+ (no f-strings-as-logging, no `match`).

## Why a gateway at all

Long-context requests take minutes to prefill. A downstream application with a 30 s
content timeout kills the request and retries it — and every retry restarts a *full*
prefill, which is how one slow request becomes a failure storm. A bare concurrency
counter is blind in exactly this window: the slot is held, the client sees nothing, then
times out. The gateway's job is to make that window observable and bounded
(heartbeat + TTFT budget), to refuse work it cannot serve promptly (admission
back-pressure), and to not pay for the same prefill twice (equivalence dedup).

## Image-placeholder sanitization (G7)

Some clients serialize a past-turn image as the engine's image special token written out
as **literal text**. An engine that validates input against those tokens rejects the
whole body with a hard `400` — and the conversation is dead, because the image bytes were
never in the request and cannot be restored.

The gateway rewrites the literal token to the plain text `[图像]` and lets the request
through. This is a **degradation bridge, not a repair**: the model then sees placeholder
text, and the fix that actually matters is on the client side (send images as `image_url`
content blocks / multimodal items). The sanitizer:

- applies to `POST /v1/chat/completions` and `POST /v1/responses` only, and runs **before**
  `enable_thinking` injection and before the dedup key, so dedup keys are computed on the
  sanitized body and stay stable;
- is **fail-open** — any body it cannot pass through a JSON round-trip safely (lone
  surrogate, pathological nesting depth) is forwarded **verbatim**, so the upstream
  produces the real 4xx instead of the gateway producing a 500;
- is **deterministic** and zero-write on the fast path: bodies without the ASCII substring
  `deepseek_image` (present in both raw-UTF-8 and `ensure_ascii` form) are returned
  byte-identical, never re-serialized;
- is observable — `image_placeholders_sanitized` (replacements) and
  `image_sanitize_requests` (requests, counted only when a rewrite actually happened) in
  `/gw/metrics`;
- has a kill switch: `SANITIZE_IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER=0` bypasses it entirely. Turn it off once
  the clients in your fleet no longer need it.

## Lineage and equivalence to the running service

This directory is a **publication copy**: comments and the module docstring are rewritten
for publication; the code is not.

| published in | `VERSION` string in the file | md5 (published file) | lines | corresponding deployment file |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| commit `01d5e8f` (v0.2.3 notes) | `concurrency-proxy-v2.0` | `dc4da4225cb04a4109988c0396b3aa1d` | 613 | pre-release snapshot, md5 `0606e1e24926d535e6f5dfdcc6fb57d3`, 649 lines |
| this tree | `concurrency-proxy-v2-rc3.7.1` | `705b746725c78b7f5e12ee0f5f199350` | 722 | the file the fleet runs, md5 `299332c1aaac5d38e7d0deb054b6869f`, 754 lines |

Equivalence for the second row: `ast.dump()` of the two files is **byte-identical** once
docstrings are excluded — comments are not in the AST at all, and **not even the version
string or the log lines had to be normalized**. The md5s therefore differ (publication
rewrote the prose) while the programs do not.

### Iteration labels retained on purpose

Two `rc3.7.1` tokens survive in `concurrency_proxy_v2.py`: the `VERSION` constant and the
sanitizer's warning line. They are kept **verbatim** so that a reader can match this
source against a live service (the same string appears in the startup banner and in every
sanitizer warning in the service journal). Every other change-history label from the
development line was removed.

The `concurrency-proxy-v2.0` string in the first row was a publication-time invention — it
corresponded to no string in any running service. Retaining the service's own label
instead makes the source → banner → journal → report chain checkable end to end.

## Running the tests

```bash
python3 gateway/test_sanitize_image_placeholders.py                    # the file next to it
python3 gateway/test_sanitize_image_placeholders.py path/to/copy.py    # any other copy
```

The module is imported, never started, so no engine is needed. The tests pin the exact
placeholder code points (written as `\uXXXX` escapes so an editor cannot silently
normalize them) and cover the two fail-open regressions: a lone surrogate and 2000-level
nesting must both come back byte-identical.

## Reference deployment

Install path and unit values in `concurrency-proxy-v2.service.example` are *examples*: the
reference fleet installs the script at a project-specific path under `/opt` and supplies
`GW_API_KEY` from the unit's environment. Note that `systemctl show -p Environment` is
world-readable on a default systemd configuration — put the key in `EnvironmentFile=`
(mode 0600) rather than an inline `Environment=` if that matters to you.
