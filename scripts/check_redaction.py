"""check_redaction.py -- fail-closed leak scan for the PUBLISHED repository tree.

Why this exists
---------------
`deliverables/engineering-assurance/sanitize_release.py` is a *masker*: it walks a
release copy and applies a replacement table.  That table covers credentials, IPs,
hostnames, the application user and one path prefix.  It has **no entry for the
network interface / HCA classes** -- the very classes the 2026-09-17 release audit
marked "must mask" in its section 3.2.1, including the per-rank `PEER_HCA` pinning
map, which the same table calls the physical ring wiring fingerprint.

A masker removes only what it knows about, and a scan that reuses the masker's class
list cannot fail on what the masker does not know about.  Policy and executor shared
one blind spot, and the omission was invisible from both ends.

This checker is deliberately *separate* from the masker, enumerates the classes
independently, and records the policy verdict per class.  It is fail-closed: an
unclassified hit in a blocker class exits non-zero.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/check_redaction.py [repo_root]     # default: repo root
    python3 scripts/check_redaction.py --selftest      # regression cases only

Exit codes
----------
    0   no unclassified hits in any blocker class
    1   at least one unclassified blocker-class hit (the scan FAILED)
    2   usage / environment error, or the scanner's own self-test failed

Scanning discipline (learned the hard way, repeatedly)
-----------------------------------------------------
- A checker's lexical model is not the target's actual syntax.  Four failures in one
  session came from this: `grep -cF '>'` counting `>>`, `key=value` parsed by field
  position, a bare `|` count treating an escaped `\\|` as a delimiter, and an inline
  shell regex losing its backslashes to quoting.  Hence a script file rather than an
  inline one-liner, and a word boundary on every pattern.
- After every write, extend the pattern set with whatever *you* just wrote.  A
  verification recipe once leaked a real host alias into a public README and survived
  a scan that only reused the previous pattern list.
- Documentation that quotes a pattern is a scan target too -- this file and the
  classification table in `benchmarks/README.md` included.  The self-test samples
  below are therefore assembled from fragments at run time: writing a real value here
  to prove the scanner can find it would put that value in the repository.
- **2026-09-24, and the rule above applied to itself.**  Two files already in the tree
  were found carrying the operator's *local* absolute path (a drive letter, `Users`, a
  real account name, and the tool's own directory), and a report being prepared for
  publication carried an address inside the management /24 that `mgmt-ip` did not
  enumerate.  Every path pattern in this file assumed POSIX and every address pattern
  enumerated hosts, so neither class was visible to it.  Classes `windows-user-path`
  and `mgmt-subnet-ip` were added after masking all three.  When you add a class, add
  its self-test case in the same edit -- the fixtures below are the regression.
- `zurih`, `?pwd=luzi` and `/opt/aicad-prod` are deliberate and load-bearing
  (attribution, published share code, published project name).  Do not "clean" them.
